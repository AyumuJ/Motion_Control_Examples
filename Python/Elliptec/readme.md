# Elliptec Example

These examples shows how you can control a Thorlabs Elliptec ELL6 and ELL17 in Python. It uses the PythonNet library. This library needs to be installed separately on the computer.

The slider ELL6 is homed and changes position forwards and backwards.

The linear stage ELL17 is homed and performs an absolute and a relative move.
